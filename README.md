# Joshua Ollendick's Portfolio Website

This portfolio is meant to show off all the projects that I have worked on during my time with Thinkful.

## Technology Used
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - jQuery
  - JavaScript
  - Photoshop
  
## Process
  1. Research
      - My first step when creating my portfolio website was to research example portfolio websites that I found appealing. I took screenshots of the elements/design ideas I thought I may want to use and placed them all into a Photoshop artboard to reference later when it came time to style. 
  
  2. Gather/Create Assets
      - I began by typing up all necessary content for my portfolio. This included my bio, contact information, project descriptions, technology used, and any links that would be necessary.
      - In Photoshop, I created each project mockup. Each mockup and photo was then optimized for the web. 
      - I located websites that contained the icons I wanted to use within my project. 
      
  3. HTML WireFrames
      - Before jumping into styling I started with creating a mobile-first HTML wireframe. This allowed me to rapidly protoype how I wanted my content laid out. I used minimal CSS at this stage, only utilizing it for positioning elements. Colors were limited to whites and greys.
      -After I was satisfied with the structure, I replaced all simple placeholder text with my actual content. 
      
  4. Styling & Progressive Enhancement
      - Before jumping into styles, I first decided on a color scheme and the fonts I wanted to use on my site. These choices ended up morphing slightly over time, but it gave me a good starting off point. 
      - I then proceeded to style the entire website for a mobile-first design, starting with a mobile-responsive nav, then the hero section, about, projects, and finally contact section.
